# Wine Classification with XGBoost

This repository contains a machine learning model trained with the XGBoost algorithm to classify wines as either red or white. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95%, showcasing its robust ability to discern patterns within the dataset's features and make accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features describing the properties of wines, such as acidity, pH levels, and alcohol content. These features were utilized by the XGBoost model to classify wines into the red or white category.

## XGBoost Model
XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency in handling complex relationships and boosting model performance. In this project, XGBoost was chosen for its ability to effectively classify wines based on the dataset's features.

## Results
The achieved accuracy of 95% demonstrates the effectiveness of the XGBoost model in classifying wines. This high accuracy is a testament to the model's ability to accurately predict wine classifications, making it a valuable tool for industries such as viticulture, wine production, and quality control.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-classification.git`
